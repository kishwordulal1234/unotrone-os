🖥️ Unotrone OS
Unotrone OS is a lightweight operating system designed for Arduino Uno, Nano, and similar AVR-based microcontrollers. It provides a basic multitasking environment, enabling the development of more complex applications directly on microcontroller hardware.

🚀 Features
Multitasking Support: Run multiple tasks concurrently with cooperative scheduling.

Modular Architecture: Easily extendable with custom modules and services.

Low Resource Footprint: Optimized for memory and processing constraints of microcontrollers.

Hardware Abstraction: Simplifies hardware interaction through a unified API.
